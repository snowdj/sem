# Structural Equation Modeling

This document attempts to introduce structural equation modeling from a broader context than what is typically presented in social, educational, and other sciences.  The content currently covers the following ground:

- Graphical models
- Latent variable models
- SEM
- Growth curve models
- Mixture models
- Item response theory
- Topic modeling
- Bayesian non-parametric models
- An overview of other miscellaneous models (e.g. recommender systems)


The first few chapters also serve as the basis of a workshop, and include a brief introduction to R that will be enough for one to follow along with the tools used (e.g. <span class="pack">psych</span>, <span class="pack">lavaan</span>, and <span class="pack">mediation</span> packages).
